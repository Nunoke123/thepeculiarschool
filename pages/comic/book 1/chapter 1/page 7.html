    <p class="narator">My rant was disturbed by a sudden change in the air.</p>
    <p class="daniel">...?</p>
    <p class="alice">A: you guys...<b>did</b>...feel that...right?</p>
    <p class="collin">C: Yeah...what...<b>was</b>...that???</p>
    <p class="narator">
        It was unlike anything we'd felt before... <br>
        The air felt thicker...the light felt darker...br <br>
        the world fell quiet...for just one moment...
        you could feel it...but the next...
    </p>
    <p class="collin">C: Anyway, who's up for waffles for lunch?!</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: No, absolutely not! We are <b>NOT</b> doing this again!</p>
    <p class="alice">A: I thought you liked waffles...</p>
    <p class="daniel">
        D: It's not about the waffles! It's about you two always ignoring the weird stuff that happends here! <br>
        Like, don't you wanna know where that feeling came from?!
    </p>
    <p class="collin">C: My guess is it came from that ominously dark doorway.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: What doorway? There's no doorwHAAAAA-</p>

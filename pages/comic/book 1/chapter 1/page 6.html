    <h1>Bathrooms</h1>
    <section class="textbox">
        <p class="narator">Anyway, we met up in the bathrooms after class...</p>
        <p class="daniel">Stupid mrs Kushim, I could swear she only gets mad at us!</p>
        <p class="collin">Just let it go dude, there's nothing we can change about it now.</p>
        <p class="daniel">There's always gotta be some bullshit happening at this school bro >:(</p>
        <p class="daniel">Like, why does mrs Kushim never retire? She's been here longer then my parents have been alive!</p>
        <p class="daniel">AND WHY ARE THE TOILETS UPSIDE DOWN?!</p>
        <p class="collin">That's a really good question actually, why are they upside down?</p>
        <p class="daniel">THAT IS <b>NOT</b> THE MAIN CONCERN!</p>
        <p class="alice">maybe it should be tho cuz like how does that work?</p>
        <p class="daniel">Y'all can <b>NOT</b> be serious right no-</p>
        <p class="narator">My rant was disturbed by a sudden change in the air.</p>
        <p class="daniel">...?</p>
        <p class="alice">you guys...<b>did</b>...feel that...right?</p>
        <p class="collin">Yeah...what...<b>was</b>...that???</p>
        <p class="narator">
            It was unlike anything we'd felt before... <br>
            The air felt thicker...the light felt darker...br <br>
            the world fell quiet...for just one moment...
            you could feel it...but the next...
        </p>
        <p class="collin">Anyway, who's up for waffles for lunch?!</p>
        <p class="daniel">No, absolutely not! We are <b>NOT</b> doing this again!</p>
        <p class="alice">I thought you liked waffles...</p>
        <p class="daniel">
            It's not about the waffles! It's about you two always ignoring the weird stuff that happends here! <br>
            Like, don't you wanna know where that feeling came from?!
        </p>
        <p class="collin">My guess is it came from that ominously dark doorway.</p>
        <p class="daniel">What doorway? There's no doorwHAAAAA-</p>

<h1>The hallway</h1>
<section class="textbox">
    <p class="narator">As I'm sure you've guessed, there was in fact an ominously dark doorway.</p>
    <p class="daniel">Okay, that was NOT there before!</p>
    <p class="alice">He's right, I didn't see it before <abbr title="Luckally i speled tat corectaly">eighter</abbr>...</p>
    <p class="daniel">Well, do you guys wanna check it out?</p>
    <p class="collin">Nooooo, I waaaaanted to go to detention.</p>
    <p class="daniel">Really?!</p>
    <p class="collin">What? NO YOU FUCKING IDIOT I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!!!</p>
    <p class="daniel">Okay...Let's go then...</p>
    <p class="narator">And so, we walked into the first anomaly of the school year.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="collin">Man, It's really dark in here...</p>
    <p class="alice">wait a second i'll turn on my flashlight</p>
    <p class="narator">Alice clicked her flashlight but it didn't turn on.</p>
    <p class="alice">huh...the battery must be dead...</p>
    <p class="collin">WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!</p>
    <p class="narator">
        There was a silhouette standing at the end of the hallway,
        <br>
        I squinted trying to get a better look at it, but there wasn't enough light.
    </p>
    <p class="alice">is it too late to turn back</p>
    <p class="collin">No, the door is still open.</p>
    <p class="narator">The door slammed shut behind us.</p>
    <p class="collin">...</p>
    <p class="daniel">Collin...</p>
    <p class="collin">...</p>
    <p class="daniel">never speak again please.</p>
    <p class="alice">should we get closer?</p>
    <p class="collin">What? NO! That's a horrible idea!</p>
    <p class="daniel">Well, I mean...We can't go back...Might as well go forward?</p>
    <p class="collin">Alright, you do you</p>
    <p class="narator">Collin shoved me forward.</p>
    <p class="daniel">FUCK YOU</p>
    <p class="narator">I hit the ground before the silhouette.</p>
    <p class="daniel">oof</p>
    <p class="collin">Are you alive?</p>
    <p class="daniel">I hate you.</p>
    <p class="collin">Alright!</p>
    <p class="narator">They walked over to me.</p>
    <p class="daniel">Why are you comming now?</p>
    <p class="Collin">I figured if it wanted to kill us it would've gotten you already by now.</p>
    <p class="narator">Uppon closer inspection it seemed to be a coathanger.</p>
    <p class="daniel">Well that was underwhelming...</p>
    <p class="narator">Suddenly, the floor opened up below us.</p>
    <p class="collin">WHAT THE?!</p>
    <p class="daniel"> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-</p>

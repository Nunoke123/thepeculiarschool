<h1>The hallway</h1>
<section class="textbox">
    <p class="narator">As I'm sure you've guessed, there was in fact an ominously dark doorway.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Okay, that was NOT there before!</p>
    <p class="alice">A: He's right, I didn't see it before <abbr title="Luckally i speled tat corectaly">eighter</abbr>...</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Well, do you guys wanna check it out?</p>
    <p class="collin">C: Nooooo, I waaaaanted to go to detention.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Really?!</p>
    <p class="collin">C: What? NO YOU FUCKING IDIOT I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!!!</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Okay...Let's go then...</p>
    <p class="narator">And so, we walked into the first anomaly of the school year.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="collin">C: Man, It's really dark in here...</p>
    <p class="alice">A: wait a second i'll turn on my flashlight</p>
    <p class="narator">Alice clicked her flashlight but it didn't turn on.</p>
    <p class="alice">A: huh...the battery must be dead...</p>
    <p class="collin">C: WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!</p>
    <p class="narator">
        There was a silhouette standing at the end of the hallway,
        <br>
        I squinted trying to get a better look at it, but there wasn't enough light.
    </p>
    <p class="alice">A: is it too late to turn back</p>
    <p class="collin">C: No, the door is still open.</p>
    <p class="narator">The door slammed shut behind us.</p>
    <p class="collin">...</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Collin...</p>
    <p class="collin">...</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: never speak again please.</p>
    <p class="alice">A: should we get closer?</p>
    <p class="collin">C: What? NO! That's a horrible idea!</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Well, I mean...We can't go back...Might as well go forward?</p>
    <p class="collin">C: Alright, you do you</p>
    <p class="narator">Collin shoved me forward.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: FUCK YOU</p>
    <p class="narator">I hit the ground before the silhouette.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: oof</p>
    <p class="collin">C: Are you alive?</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: I hate you.</p>
    <p class="collin">C: Alright!</p>
    <p class="narator">They walked over to me.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Why are you comming now?</p>
    <p class="Collin">C: I figured if it wanted to kill us it would've gotten you already by now.</p>
    <p class="narator">Uppon closer inspection it seemed to be a coathanger.</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: Well that was underwhelming...</p>
    <p class="narator">Suddenly, the floor opened up below us.</p>
    <p class="collin">C: WHAT THE?!</p>
    <p class="daniel">D: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-</p>
